# Security

Unfortunately, at the moment this project does not have a bug bounty program, we're working on setting up one.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please reach out to any admins of [our telegram group](https://t.me/+8T4wA24yWr8wYTQ0).

If you prefer to reach out to an independent security group, please use the [Security Alliance SEAL 911 bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot).

- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
